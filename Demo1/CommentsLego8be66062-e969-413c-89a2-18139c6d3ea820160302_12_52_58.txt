This would coincide with the recent holiday sets (Valentines and Easter) which are great display pieces.  I believe this is also the size of the Female Scientist sets from last year.  This would make these more of individual, collectible display item, and thus may attract people who may normally not buy LEGO.\n\nYou may also consider not limiting this to mini-fig scale.  A Mount Rushmore set might be built in micro(mini)-scale.  Or, a Smoky Mountains set might feature a river with a salamander.  Trying to capture all of the parks will be a challenge if you focus on incorporating both an animal and mini-fig into each.\n\nGreat work.

The National Park General Authorities Act of 1970 and the Redwood Act of 1978 made sure that every park from Yellowstone to Thaddeus Kosciusko were considered equal.  The submitted builds for this set had three iconic National Parks.  I chose them because they had good identifiable animals and plants, and because my original collection with Gettysburg National Military Park was rejected.  As an archeologist I am very keen to get a good cultural resource park in the mix.  I have since come up with a build for Independence National Historical Park.  As far as showing love to other NPS designations, I also have a build for Assateague Island National Seashore.  Check out the updates for photos of these two vignettes and others.

Yosemite is quite famous for its rock climbing like the Half Dome or El Capitan. There would be some fun ways for rock climbing. Mount Rainier is much like Great Smoky Mountains. It has a lot to do there but not a really big attraction besides the mountain. There is rock and glacier climbing though. It would make a interesting set. Now Big Bend is really cool. I think a hiking/camping set would be cool. There are lots of day hikes through desert and rocky areas. There is also overnight backpacking. I know it is a lot to squeeze into that amount space.

The rules of LEGO Ideas state you can only propose a set, not a new theme.  So for the purpose of this set, which I hope would include three or four different vignettes, I can\u0027t suggest a larger Dry Tortugas build.  That said, a small vignette of visitors snorkeling along the most wall, with a random resident crocodile would be great.","user_vote":"1"},{"id":"b3c0e2a7-ed2b-4b2e-9ac1-9d3ecd39e6bd","author":"LegoRanger16","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1440117840","comment":"For larger sets featuring National Park sites I recommend searching for the great set dedicated to Golden Spike, or the recent one featuring Independence Hall.","user_vote":"1"},{"id":"9fda0693-a058-458f-a4a7-8d64b55d5bb1","author":"BobH5719","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1440512199","comment":"Haven\u0027t been to Dry Tortugas yet but, just can from a revisit to Castillo De San Marcos (St. Augustine).

If it doesn\u0027t reach 10,000 then there\u0027s no hope for any of us! I thought of a national park you could also make called Bodie. It\u0027s in California and it\u0027s a ghost town. There is rumoured to be actual ghosts there, so I thought that could be fun to make. I\u0027ve been there but it started to really rain which cut our trip short.

However, there were a couple modules I didn\u0027t like, mainly the liberty bell and Springfield armory. The liberty bell is hardly recognizable as a bell, partially due to the pixilation from size but also partially from the drastic color changes throughout the bell. Maybe smooth tiles in some patches would look better?
