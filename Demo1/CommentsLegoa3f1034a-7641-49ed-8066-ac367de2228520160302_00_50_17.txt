It\u0027s kidfriendly, it\u0027s popular among AFOLs and I think it could be transformed into Legomodel in a way that provides a lot of playability. Good luck for the rest of your journey to 10k!","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"917ae6a9-ec25-4ce5-8b82-af7adeb3dbae","author":"tgrbailey","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1456660700","comment":"I agree, thus will easily get to 10k for the may review","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"74c6aa70-bd40-47d4-8520-d40e58eac27b","author":"Pavlusha1984","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1456682281","comment":"Support \u0026amp; good luck!","user_vote":"1"}]
