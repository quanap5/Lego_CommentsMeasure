I love the hinge to open the complete building. My favorite details are the spiral staircase, the shelves full of bottles, and the balance scale. I have two concerns:\n\n1. It looks like the rooms are too deep for playing. It looks really hard to reach into the rooms to manipulate the items and figures. As gorgeous as the outside is, I wonder if you could shorten the house on its long side so that the rooms are shallower when open and still fit in enough of your wonderful details and design.\n\n2. The name. Are kids really going to want a set with \"pharmacy\" in the name? Perhaps \"alchemist\" or \"healer\" would be a better choice.\n\nOf course, these are details that can be worked out later. Your first version here is really great!","user_vote":"3"},{"id":"9e7c718c-86a4-410c-b32f-0f09807a5073","author":"nunki-psi","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1431112056","comment":"Thank you for your support! I think the rooms are easy to use, especially with hands of children ;) Maybe it is not that easy to reach the items back inside the two oriels, but still possible. I had to do a compromise between the outside look and the inside playability. I aimed two target groups: adult Lego fans and children. I wanted to name in particular the building itself, not the profession of its servants, that´s why I chose \"pharmacy\". There is no \"medicus\" or \"healer\" working inside. It is just a drugstore ;) But \"alchemist\" would be an alternative, I will think about it!

I only have one suggestion.\n\nIn medieval times, pharmacy would have been a very strange word. On the other hand, many cities and towns would have at least one apothecary, which fulfilled the role of supplying medication that modern pharmacies fulfill.

It would be a very nice break from the line of Knights vs. Bad Knights themes we\u0027ve had. There would be so many possibilities: A Town gate, walls, An Inn, a Blacksmith, stables,  an apothecary like this, a Guildhall, a market, etc. Of course, to prevent it from getting boring, there would still be conflict. after all, tons are full of criminals, and they can get besieged as well.","user_vote":"4"},{"id":"9e7c718c-86a4-410c-b32f-0f09807a5073","author":"nunki-psi","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1431813531","comment":"I thought about that too. A whole theme based on a medieval town would be what I personally wish. But I don´t like buildings which are like a \"coulisse\", with no backwall. Sure it is easier to play with for children, but it just doesn´t look complete. I personally prefer the solution of opening in the middle like the \"Haunted House\" or the buildings of the \"Medieval Market Village\", thats why I desided to do it that way. I think what the Lego medieval world definitely needs is a church or a convent. I really would love to design this, but I think Ideas would not approve it, because it is a religious building. What do you think?","user_vote":"9"},{"id":"a7cd3985-0cff-46fd-ae2b-cd34adb5191f","author":"Bobbywan","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1431959026","comment":"I agree! The Medieval market Village was the perfect balance of playability and appearance, which is probably why it remained on sale so long after the rest of your theme. I also agree about the church or convent. The Lego medieval world isn\u0027t complete without them, but I don\u0027t think Lego would allow one actually called that. But I think you could do something like a project on here called Winter village Castle Keep by Adamsenna that just \"happens\" to look like a church. So maybe you could make, for example a \"university\" filled with \"scholars\" that would just \"happen\" to resemble a monastary and monks. I think its the only way it would work.","user_vote":"4"},{"id":"9e7c718c-86a4-410c-b32f-0f09807a5073","author":"nunki-psi","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1431959277","comment":"Thank you very much for your suggestions.

Do you know the official Lego set \"Haunted House?\" (10228). The access is there similar to my creation and definitely has tons of play features. I think children could stick in their hands easiliy here. I definitely don´t agree that it has no play features. The other thing is, if TLG desides to produce this set, they are free to change whatever they want anyway. Have you seen my Medieval Bakery too? Maybe you´ll like the access solution on that model more.","user_vote":"3"},{"id":"eea2c235-48f9-46ce-a05c-dee15ba9abaa","author":"Anduin1710","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1441370843","comment":"Woohoo!

You seem to hit the nail on the head with colour composition, styling, overall atmosphere. I love the chimney of the Pharmacy, the well outside, accessories/amenities inside (each compartment is lovely - and the spider web of course!), \"lazy\" busyness around and inside - a design with loads of character. It just begs to build the entire series of such buildings. Just perfect!","user_vote":"1"},{"id":"9e7c718c-86a4-410c-b32f-0f09807a5073","author":"nunki-psi","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1443889825","comment":"It makes me happy that you took such a close look at this project. I tried to create a medieval building with an aesthetic look outside, especially for adults, and high playability inside for the younger generation. I don´t like buildings which are completely open on one side. They always give me a feeling of a theater coulisse. I would really love so see such buildings as official Lego sets. If my creations could make a contribution to realize a new interpretation of the Classic Castle theme, I would be incredible happy! This theme has so much potential and I´m feeling honored to get attention on that.

The specific topic of my thesis is whether this community qualifies as a traditional brand community. Therefore, I am looking for active users that would be willing to answer a few simple questions (in writing) about their motivation for participating and contributing to LEGO Ideas. I have already talked to LEGO to get their perspective but would like to add depth to the case by implementing a user perspective.\n\nI hope that some of you would want to help out! Please contact me on charlotte_in@hotmail.com for further information. I hope to hear from some of you. Age, nationality and gender is not important. You\u0027ll of course be anonymous, if you wish.\n\nBest regards\nCharlotte","user_vote":"0"},{"id":"6a02f862-58c2-4317-8375-9dccecfac1b9","author":"ClintonThe4th","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1449518687","comment":"Nice detail and design    supported!","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"9e7c718c-86a4-410c-b32f-0f09807a5073","author":"nunki-psi","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1449570900","comment":"Thank you! :)","user_vote":"1"},{"id":"d344cf90-314e-4de5-bf81-464a70671789","author":"lmoravec","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1449955494","comment":"I\u0027ve heard of a wine cellar, but is that a wine attic I see in the updates?
