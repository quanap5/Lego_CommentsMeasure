I bought all pieces and we put them together following the description and it worked perfectly. Our accelerator still does not look so beautiful like the one on the photo but it is as simple as the pure accelerator from the construction manual but already like this it was really useful. We had an outreach event where we had among other stuff the accelerator and we attracted a lot of people to our stand just by having it running and then we could use it as a start point for explanations. Really cool! If one day you also have the description how to make it so beautiful like on the photo I would not complain. ;)\n\nThanks and ciao","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"6eac8717-9c76-4171-afc4-7c94843c8156","author":"Andrepg","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1430055693","comment":"I love you!
