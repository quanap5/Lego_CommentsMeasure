While I will not argue for a particular project, there were 13 amazing and quite different projects. Rejecting all 13 projects is holding their creators *and* supporters in contempt, including your T-Rex. \n\nI see that there can be many reasons why projects are not approved. But it is hard to believe that not a single project of this review period did not meet all required criteria to become a product. The results of this review period are not transparent enough in my point of view. \n\nI hope we will see a more detailed explanation in the future. You, all other creators and their fans would deserve it. And in the meantime: Brick on!","user_vote":"6"},{"id":"5e260a63-05e4-404c-a2ed-fc0d656f03c1","author":"Alcor","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1446379601","comment":"Quite true... :C","user_vote":"4"},{"id":"12a1a235-a5fa-429a-afb5-775ae05f9a09","author":"Legoboy9247","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1446673190","comment":"I have no idea what Lego was thinking on that one...
