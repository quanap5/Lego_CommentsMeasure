I remember watching The Golden Girls every day as a kid after school with my mom and sister. It was our ritual. I know every episode by heart. I watch them whenever they are on T.V and it never gets old. This show was an amazing mixture of comedy and drama (but mostly comedy.) They had episodes about a lot of issues that no other show at its time spoke about, interracial marriage, homosexuality, AIDs etc. This would be such an iconic piece to add to my LEGO collection. Yes, a 28 year old builds LEGOS and I am proud of it. PLEASE LEGO, MAKE THIS HAPPEN!
