Genaro isn’t included in that project, so he should come in any other set.\n\nI agree that Muldoon works better in a Raptor cage set. If Garm4n’s project reaches 10k, I could consider to remove the Muldoon fig from my project.\n\nHowever, if I remove Muldoon or Genaro to make room for other minifigures, Ian Malcolm and Dennis Nedry should be the first ones to be added: everyone is asking for them in the comments.","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"4be4cc3c-a96f-406a-8241-6b5e4c1772ee","author":"NoSoupForYou","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1436720767","comment":"The same set that includes Gennaro should have a utility shed/ outhouse with \"demolition\" action.","user_vote":"1"},{"id":"6c5c2018-5ded-4bc6-8bb3-b1ba9788fc1e","author":"BrickadierG","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1439509584","comment":"Sorry for the very late reply.
