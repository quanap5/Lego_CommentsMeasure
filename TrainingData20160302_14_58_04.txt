I am also working on \"Lego History - Paul Revere and the Midnight Ride\", \"Lego History - Ben Franklin\u0027s Lightning Rod\", \"Lego History - Rosa Parks Gets A Good Seat\", \"Lego History - Battle of Bunker Hill\"  These are all working titles, and there are many more.    I have already build 3 of them, working on them in LDD too. This is my first Lego Idea hopefully of many ABOUT \"Neil Makes is to the Moon\" is made up primarily of all generic pieces.   This would not be a complicated build for anyone.  It is one of my first builds and I look forward to the support of the community.  I do not have any expectations.  Would be nice just to hear a few comments and get a few votes THE LEGO STORY Neil was a very shy boy.  His parents tried to persuade him to play sports and be social with friends at school.  But Neil was a smart kid who enjoyed science and making experiments.  One day while watching TV, Neil saw a show on space exploration and has never been the same.  He spent the rest of his school years studying to be the best astronaut he can be. So today we celebrate as Neil made it to space.

Johnny Five, is the hero of the Short Circuit movies. Number 5 was one of five prototype robots, but after being struck by lightning gained a sense of awareness and free will. The multitude of his expressive abilities, combined with a youthful demeanor and thirst for knowledge (need more input!), made him an instant favorite with audiences in the 80\u0027s. This small model attempts to replicate the sense of wonder that the robot often displayed. It stands around 7\" tall and is very flexible. Arms, torso, head, and even \u0027eyebrows\u0027 can be posed however desired. Also featured are a retracting shoulder-mount and freely moving treads.  Number 5 contains approximately 300 pieces, making this an ideal mid-range set.","tag":["Number 5","Johnny Five","Johnny 5","Short Circuit","Alive","Robot","That movie with Steve Guttenberg"],"status":"Gathering Support","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":7.770814463493706,"concern":0.6955181206597222,"no_supporter":8058,"no_follower":1000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"132944","project":"b617b03e-af7c-471e-a720-ad0d7439a51b","User":"Jeddy and Daddy","Date_project":"Mar 01, 2016","title":"Orc War Boar","description":"The future is bright... The future is green... The future is armoured... And it sits on 2000 pounds of evil smelling tusked terror! This rider was one of the strongest and meanest in his tribe and has spent its entire life fighting whilst riding the fierce War Boar, which naturally brought the attention of Ugglug the Orc, scourge of Middle Zealand. Having been hand-picked personally by Ugglug himself, and kitted out in the finest armour scavenged from a hundred different battlefields, this Orc is now one of Ugglug\u0027s closest lieutenants, a trusted member of the warband known as Ugglug\u0027s Armoured Orcs. If you see it on the battlefield, beware! Ugglug and the rest of his band are sure to be close at hand. ____________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ DESIGN NOTES Interestingly enough, I\u0027m not the greatest fan when it comes to brick-built animals generally. Consider the amazing shape, quality and articulation of the modern mould of LEGO horses for example and how impossible it would be to re-create that with normal elements. However I came across this initial design four years or so ago, which inspired me to take a look at recreating this classic mount for an Orc warrior. My version has changed quite significantly since then, with at least two major redesigns of the head - allowing for a printed eye as well as the snout and nostrils (which I think is fun as it is particularly boar-y) as well incorporating modifiable saddle accessories and an updated tail section. This has probably sat on my shelf for a good year at least, during which some minor tinkering has taken place, before its eventual inclusion here. A significant addition to the lieutenants were the arrival of ultron sentry officer helmets, which rounds it off really nicely. This set is a nice size for a Polybag (as an introduction to a new fantasy/castle line) and would contain enough extra saddle / boar accessories (chains, weapons and clips) to allow some variation in boar design, but without losing the feel that these troops are definitely an organised unit... at least for Orcs that is! (Particularly if people wanted to make multiple purchases) Even if collectors weren\u0027t especially fans of having an Orc riding the boar, there will be plenty of Lord of the Rings fans that could use the modified boar as a mount for Dáin II Ironfoot from the Battle of the Five Armies Set. As for the final design of the Orc itself, I went for the fantasy era (sand green) Troll warrior as I really like their face. It isn\u0027t too angry or fierce looking like some of the LOTR ones (not that there\u0027s anything wrong with them) but it still has a satisfyingly Orcish expression to it. However I am open for the minifgure design to change - especially since that particular minifigure used is not currently in production (as far as I know). It is, after all, the boar that is the unique and important part of this set.

When it gets 10.000 votes, it will be evaluated by The LEGO Group] Over the years, almost every new LEGO movie licensed theme has been created to match with a new theatrical release. In the case of big movie franchises, some sets based on previous films were produced before the ones based on the new films. This has happened with \"STAR WARS\", \"Toy Story\", or \"Indiana Jones\". So a good reason to release a fourth Jurassic Park movie was the chance to see LEGO products for the previous films, right? Strangely, the last product license ignores the previous movies and is based only on the last film in the series, \"Jurassic World\". It looks a lost opportunity for such a license deal.   The key elements in the Jurassic Park films are the dinosaurs, but the movies are also filled with lots of iconic vehicles, locations and characters with a lot of potential for a complete building toy line. The biggest set in a utopian Jurassic Park Theme would be the Visitor Center. This project features a complex building in the facade, as well as some rooms inside to recreate every scene in the movie: Main entrance hall, with two brick built skeletons: a sauropod and a Tyrannosaurus. “Les Gigantes” restaurant, with gift shop. Kitchen. V.I.P. Dining Room Emergency bunker Showcase theatre Control room Genetics lab with cold storage room The rooms can be hinged or detached for a better play experience. There is also space for a secret compartment at the main entrance, under the stairs. The dinosaurs menu… I mean, the minifigures included would be: John Hammond Tim Murphy Lex Murphy Donald Gennaro Ray Arnold Robert Muldoon And “The Big One” molded raptor (A.K.A. “Clever Girl”).   Model specifications (note that this could change if the project becomes a product) Pieces: 2623 Measures: 43’1x 28 x 20’7 cm Thanks for reading.

Each of these three vignettes represent Park Rangers with visitors in different park environments.  The settings are constructed on 10X16 base plates, each parks from a different corner of the country, and each with a different significance.  This set is both educational and provides a fun play and building experience.  With the Centennial of the National Park service in 2016, the time is right to join the celebration of “America’s Best Idea”.  The park vignettes includes: Everglades National Park: Located in Florida, Everglades National Park protects the world renowned wetland ecosystem that is home to an amazing variety of plants and animals.  This vignette shows a Park Ranger and excited visitor passing a basking alligator while canoeing this incredible wilderness.    Katmai National Park and Preserve: Located in Alaska, Katmai is home to thousands of giant Brown Bears that feed on salmon at the mouth of the Brooks River.  This vignette shows a Park Ranger and visitor overlooking a Brown Bear attempting to catch salmon swimming upstream. Saguaro National Park: Located in Arizona, Saguaro National Park preserves a portion of the beautiful Sonoran Desert, home to the iconic, and giant, saguaro cactus.  This vignette shows a Park Ranger and visitor on a bird walk amongst the desert vegetation.  Watch out for that snake!  ","tag":["Katmai","Saguaro","Park Ranger","National Park Service","National Parks","cactus","salmon","Brown Bear","centennial","2016","America\u0027s Best Idea","parks","park","everglades","canoe","alligator","bear","vignette","vignettes"],"status":"In Review","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":8.09536811307982,"concern":0.7523025284900284,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":1000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"96133","project":"fe2aa9ed-e0c4-4bf1-aa09-8d54dfd6b094","User":"alexander2184","Date_project":"Mar 02, 2015","title":"Grandpa Greg","description":"Grandpa Greg and his scooter The set includes one minifigure; grandpa Greg.
