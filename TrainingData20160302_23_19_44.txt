They\u0027ll also use a lot of brick and stone textures and even part a cobble stone road. Rather than just giving all the buildings white roofs and sitting them on a white ground to imply snow, I wanted the snow to look like it was actually sitting on top of the streets and buildings. Walk ways have been shoveled and roof snow has been partially melted off. This gives it a more natural look. On the streets there will be scenes of carolers, the hustle and bustle of holiday shoppers and children playing. The buildings would have store fronts such as a toy store, a bakery or a pub (all featured here). Inside the upper levels there will be  classic holiday scenes like: opeing presents, preparing holiday dinner, singing to the piano, etc...    This is a fairly large piece so it might have to simplified to be realistic as a single set. Perhaps removing one of the buildings, or reducing the number of floors. ","tag":["holiday","christmas","london","vintage","snow","winter","old","horse","Britain","England","Victorian","historical","19th century","december"],"status":"In Review","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":8.402164130866586,"concern":0.3945742895222062,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":2000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"106851","project":"7d35c10b-0127-4374-8ee3-e8af891ad9dd","User":"Matthew Inman","Date_project":"Jun 26, 2015","title":"Toyota Landcruiser 40 Series","description":"  Toyota Landcruiser 40 Series If you’ve spent any time in the Australian outback, or remote and rugged terrain elsewhere in the world, the Toyota Landcruiser four-wheel-drive would be a familiar sight. And while these days you see plenty of Landcruisers in the city too, it is the early model 40 Series that has become an icon.   In Australia, it set the standard for toughness and reliability in the four-wheel-drive market, building Toyota’s reputation and becoming a favourite in the mining, agriculture, construction and engineering sectors. In many other countries in the world, it was equally popular as a reliable vehicle for tough environments. My first car was a diesel 40 Series Landcruiser, and apart from the sentimental value, I knew the distinctive body shape and interesting features would make a great model. Having already built the Lego Mini Cooper and the Kombi, the 40 Series Landcruiser rounds out the trio nicely for those who like to get off-road. This model reproduces unique features of the BJ42 – the pinnacle of the 40 Series – such as the triple windscreen wipers of course with perhaps the only thing missing is the zebra-striped pattern on the seats.  I also included lots of detail with foot well vents on both driver and passenger sides, the chassis and running gear along with the leaf springs. Comprising approximately 1700 bricks, this model is a classic four-wheel-drive.

THANK YOU \u003d)    Intro Released in 1968, “Yellow Submarine” is an animated musical fantasy film inspired by the music of the Beatles, arguably the greatest rock band of all time. This model is inspired by the iconic submarine from which the film (and associated soundtrack album) gets its title. Basic Info Dimensions: Length 26 cm x Width 5.5 cm x Height (w/stand) 16 cm Number of Pieces: 409 Model Description This model was built using LEGO Digital Designer (LDD). It features a functioning propeller and rudder, as well as a set of periscopes that can rotate to different angular positions. Perhaps the funnest part of this model, however, is that the top cover of the chassis is removable to reveal a cockpit that fits all four minifig Beatles members. Note that Technic blocks with holes and transparent round 1x1 plates were used for the windows. It is difficult to tell from the digital renders, but through the windows you can see whether the vessel is occupied or not.      Though the submarine fits the minifigs nicely, I made the submarine much smaller than it would otherwise be if it were “true” minifig scale. In “true” minifig scale, the submarine would be considerably larger and would require many more pieces. At the current size and piece count, this is a very manageable sized model for play as well as display.     Minifigs The custom minifigs of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr were based on their respective likenesses featured on the film poster / soundtrack cover. A few exceptions were made by necessity or by choice. For example, some colours were altered and colour schemes simplified due to limitations of LDD. George\u0027s longer hair reflects him during a different phase of the Beatles, but was used here to help distinguish him from the other three members. Comments, questions, and constructive feedback of this model is greatly appreciated.

Each of these three vignettes represent Park Rangers with visitors in different park environments.  The settings are constructed on 10X16 base plates, each parks from a different corner of the country, and each with a different significance.  This set is both educational and provides a fun play and building experience.  With the Centennial of the National Park service in 2016, the time is right to join the celebration of “America’s Best Idea”.  The park vignettes includes: Everglades National Park: Located in Florida, Everglades National Park protects the world renowned wetland ecosystem that is home to an amazing variety of plants and animals.  This vignette shows a Park Ranger and excited visitor passing a basking alligator while canoeing this incredible wilderness.    Katmai National Park and Preserve: Located in Alaska, Katmai is home to thousands of giant Brown Bears that feed on salmon at the mouth of the Brooks River.  This vignette shows a Park Ranger and visitor overlooking a Brown Bear attempting to catch salmon swimming upstream. Saguaro National Park: Located in Arizona, Saguaro National Park preserves a portion of the beautiful Sonoran Desert, home to the iconic, and giant, saguaro cactus.  This vignette shows a Park Ranger and visitor on a bird walk amongst the desert vegetation.  Watch out for that snake!  ","tag":["Katmai","Saguaro","Park Ranger","National Park Service","National Parks","cactus","salmon","Brown Bear","centennial","2016","America\u0027s Best Idea","parks","park","everglades","canoe","alligator","bear","vignette","vignettes"],"status":"In Review","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":8.09536811307982,"concern":0.7523025284900284,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":1000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"93900","project":"7a2318bf-367f-4bf9-bbfd-1d4d93189a45","User":"LuisPG","Date_project":"Feb 03, 2015","title":"HMS Beagle","description":"HMS Beagle: A Voyage of Researches Between 1831 and 1836, the survey ship HMS Beagle and its crew made an exploration trip around the world. Although the main goal of the voyage was to map the southern tip of South America, this trip was much greater importance to science, as one of the passengers was Charles Darwin. This Lego project consist in the HMS Beagle at minifig scale and three vignettes with key moments of the voyage. It features 8 minifigs, including Charles Darwin and Captain Fitzroy. HMS Beagle (minifig scale) The HMS Beagle was built with great detail and as accurately as possible, using 2024 pieces.  Vignettes During the voyage Darwin made multiple field research in the areas of zoology, botany, paleontology and geology and sent letters with his findings and collected specimens to England. When Darwin returned to England, he was considered a experienced scientist and researcher.  The set includes three vignettes, each showing a key moment of the observations and discoveries made by Darwin in the voyage: 1) Discovery of fossils in Patagonia, Argentina. In the vignette we can see Darwin studying the fossil skull of a Megatherium, a giant extinct mammal. 2) Study of the geology of the Andes Mountains, Chile. Darwin found fossils of marine animals high in the mountains. Also you can see a Vinchuca Bug (a big black bug that sucked Darwin´s blood). 3) Observations on the diversity of animals and plants in the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the vignette we can see Darwin riding a giant Galapagos tortoise. You can also see a finch and a cactus flowering.   The Lego model of the Beagle has a secret compartment, the back of the boat can be opened and it exposes the captain Fitzroy\u0027s cabin. Because of the high historical, scientific and educational importance of the theme, I think this set would be a great addition to collections of Lego, and both kids and adults could learn a lot while they play, evoking the travel of these great explorers of the nineteenth century, whose discoveries changed the way we understand nature. The inspiration for the vignettes come from reading the book \"A Naturalist´s Voyage Round the World: The Voyage of the Beagle\" by Charles Darwin. The main source of information and diagrams on this ship was the book “HMS Beagle: Anatomy of the ship”, by Karl Heinz Marquardt.

One of the only two SuperSonic Transports to enter commercial service, the other being the Tu-144 Charger, the Concorde revolutionized trans-Atlantic travel and set several astonishing world speed records. This came at a cost however, as some serious noise pollution was created from the frequent breaking of the sound barrier. The Concorde was nevertheless one of the safest passenger aircraft, with only a single fatal accident in 2000 which was due to debris on the runway. Finally, after almost 40 years of service, the Concorde\u0027s career came to an end in 2003, with all aircraft retiring from either British Airways or Air France service. About the model: I\u0027ve always wanted to build a Concorde! With so many small-scale models around and already one impressive large scale model by Ed Diment (Lego Monster), I felt it was time someone attempted a mid-scale version. I also found it quite exciting to work on a more sculptural model, as I am more familiar with using smooth wedges at minifig scale.  As a bonus I have included a slightly larger scaled model of the after-burning Bristol Olympus engine that powered the Concorde. Hope you will enjoy all the cool features such as the working visor, which I have only seen on one other Lego model (Ed Diment\u0027s). Features: Working nose droop mechanism, with lowering visor! Movable control surfaces Detailed fixed landing gear Detailed fuselage \u0026 engine sections Fuselage is built around a technic brick frame for maximum structural strength Includes a slightly larger scaled Bristol Olympus engine on its dolly as part of the display set  The Bristol Olympus, later produced by Rolls Royce, was the power plant of the Concorde Part count: Concorde + Bristol Olympus\u003d 838 + 58\u003d 896 bricks Measures an impressive 79.5 cm in length!

THANKS!!! _______________ MERCI BEAUCOUP to TheLittlePrince.com and its different language websites and Facebook pages (with over 7 million fans) for all of your support! The Antoine de Saint-Exupery Estate is supporting this project and has been incredibly helpful. The Little Prince is (c) the Antoine de Saint-Exupery Estate 2014. _______________ UPDATE: Thanks to GlenBricker for the great rendering of the Asteroid B-612! I am now collaborating with him on this project. Stay tuned as there will be additional images posted.... Here is the Breguet 14 that Saint-Ex flew (the airplane he is most famous for flying). _______________ PROJECT DESCRIPTION: ”It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\" -Saint-Exupery. This is my 1st submission to Cuusoo. The Little Prince would make a wonderful Lego set because it is a timeless classic enjoyed by children and adults all over the world. The story was first published 70 years ago, in 1943, and there are over 2 million copies sold each year (with the total over 400 million). It has the world record as the most translated novel in the world (over 280 translations so far - and let\u0027s translate it into LEGO together!). This would make a great gift item for adults and children, and would be something that some of TLG\u0027s bookseller partners (for example, Barnes and Noble) could market as well in conjunction with the book. \"All grown ups were once children... but only a few of them remember it\" wrote Saint-Exupery, but I think that AFOLs are some of the few that do. I have a few ideas: THE LITTLE PRINCE: We would likely need to decide on one of two versions - 1) the iconic version used on the cover for many editions (green pants, green shirt with buttons and red bow tie, red belt) or 2) the image with the cape and sword - \"the best portrait\" - that the narrator drew of him. Ideally the hair would be the same as the male tennis player CMF, and the sword for the second version would use the \"Three Musketeer\" CMF sword. For the 2nd version, rather than creating a new textile robe, it would be easier to simply have him wear a blue and a red cape together. ASTEROID B-612: Based on the December 2013 guidance from Cuusoo, I adjusted this description. For the asteroid, I\u0027d either 1) use a base plate and half the asteroid coming out of it, using curved pieces that are already in the Lego supply, or 2) use pieces to make a \"ball\" out of Legos (see main image above). This would include the rose (with glass globe), a sheep (there is now a LEGO Friends sheep), a chair, other flowers, and - of course - volcanoes to be affixed to the asteroid. A black (or preferably dark blue) background with white or yellow \"stars\" as a base would complete this part. AIRPLANE: Saint-Exupery crashed in the desert in real life, and that partly inspired the novel. The narrator of the story is working on his downed airplane when he first meets The Little Prince, so it makes sense to include the him (St.-Ex) and the airplane. The airplane would include tools and food. There are other sections of the book that could be imagined in Lego form as well (and it would be good to have a fox - hopefully the Friends animal line will come out with one soon), but I think the two main scenes would be the asteroid and the airplane (or have one scene that combines them both - we are working on that). To be consistent with the new Cuusoo guidelines, my proposal is to have A) The Little Prince minifigure, B) the Asteroid B-612, and C) Antoine de Saint-Exupery with his airplane. I hope this proposal brings a smile to your face and that you find it to be \"unique in all the world\". Here is a version of B-612 on a base plate. Note the rose under glass, the volcanoes, and the stars. Another view of the Breguet 14. This is a two-seater. There is cargo space where I\u0027ve placed a bottle of wine, a goblet, a croissant, and some cheese, and another space for a tool box and a wrench (to fix the plane when it crashes). If you came across this project a couple months ago, here\u0027s what you would have seen for the designs. Note the two Lego recreations of the narrator\u0027s \"best portrait\" of the Little Prince (from Chapter 2). This would be paired up with the Saint-Exupery and his airplane. I used Luke Skywalker\u0027s head and shirt, two capes, the CMF tennis player\u0027s hair, and the CMF Musketeer\u0027s sword. Ideally he\u0027d have the short capes like those used for Hobbit sets and of course his own Minifigure details (such as purple boots rather than completely purple legs). _______________ OTHER PROJECTS: Please also support these great projects by glenbricker (some in partnership with other great designers): X-Men: X-Mansion: https://ideas.lego.com/projects/53799 Assault on Wayne Manor: https://ideas.lego.com/projects/50007 The Big Bang Theory: https://ideas.lego.com/projects/58456 (10K achieved!)
