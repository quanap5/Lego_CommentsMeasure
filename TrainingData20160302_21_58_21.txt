I liked the Christmas sets so I built this one on Lego Digital Designer (LDD). I really believe that this model could have a lot of genuine interest to fans of Christmas sets. This is the first of a series of modular buildings that I will be making.   Summary The building consists of roughly 2160 parts and three floors: the main store, office, and lookout. I used the colors brown and sand green that gives it a realistic feeling. Three Mini-figures could be added such as a fisherman, the store keeper, one captain. And a lot of details. It includes: Mini fish, crab, flicking hook, starfish, snow owl, Barrels, If you like this design or the idea of a Old Fishing Store - Modular Building  please support and follow, thanks for reading and Brick On everyone !","tag":["modular","modular building","fishing","sets","christmas","building","store","boat","dock"],"status":"Achieved Support","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":7.84933998668715,"concern":0.13840103832155853,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":1000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"86253","project":"c81dfa92-81f0-45aa-821c-e068d215ce75","User":"JKBrickworks","Date_project":"Nov 24, 2014","title":"Particle Accelerator","description":"Help these intrepid scientists with their quest to find the (Mini)Figgs Boson! Or maybe just to find out what a 2x4 LEGO brick is made of. This working particle accelerator uses a simple system of spinning wheels to accelerate a LEGO ball around a ring. Although the propulsion system is different than that of a real particle accelerator, it\u0027s a great way to illustrate the concept. Not to mention, it is fun to play with. Multiple balls can be inserted simultaneously and obstacles can be introduced for the ball(s) to collide with. The set could be scaled anywhere from the basic accelerator and ring (which combined are only 170 pieces) all the way up to a fully styled installation like the one I have designed. The inclusion of a small control room with a few minifig scientists would also be a nice addition and add to the play value. Be sure to check out the updates, as I will be posting step by step building instructions for building the basic ring and accelerator.","tag":["science","physics","research","jk brickworks","space","universe","motorized","particle","accelerator","particle accelerator","scientist","scientist lab","scientist engineer project","science at work","science moc by fol","research lab"],"status":"Achieved Support","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":7.845037560609354,"concern":1.1693163639148054,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":1000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"101885","project":"879f2041-22ea-4b06-9e34-ed074c4ce83a","User":"LegoWolf","Date_project":"Apr 30, 2015","title":"Modular Train Station","description":"Add your favourite locomotive to your Lego modular street with a train station! To fit in with the early twentieth century look of other buildings in the series, this model takes inspiration from nineteenth century stations in Europe. These structures were cathedrals to industry, marrying classical stonework and statuary with technological innovations like all-glass roofs. Many of these stations are still in use and have been renovated over the decades, bringing in advances like electric lights and RFID cards. Features: The platform at the back lets you lay track in the same direction as your street, so that your diorama can fit in a compact space. The platform height is sized for standard Lego trains. There is equal detail on front and back, which is unusual for modular buildings. The roof and upper back wall detach, exposing the vaulted interior for play. The focal point inside is the ornate clock and timetable, which features replaceable letters so that you can set your own destinations. The interior features a ticketing office, ticket vending machine, newspaper box, snack bar, public toilets, and turnstiles leading to the platform. The exterior features statuary, decorative moulding and brickwork, and arched glass windows. There is a bicycle rack for couriers in the front, along with public noticeboards. A snack bar opens onto the interior and the station platform, because captive customers are profitable customers! Suggested Figures: Ticket vendor, snack seller, businesswoman commuter, bicycle courier. Statistics: Size: 10” W x 10” D x 12” H / 25.5cm W x 25.5cm D x 30cm H Approximately 3000 bricks Decals: The illuminated noticeboards on the front are intended to have decals of postings and handbills, and the yellow sign on the back is intended to bear a railway logo suitable for the local region. I intend to add these myself when I can figure out a good home technique.

With this model you will be able to reconstruct the decisive moments of the second Star Wars trilogy (Ep. I, II \u0026 III): from the first meeting with the little Anakin, to the growth of the Dark Side of the Force with the unborn Darth Vader. A setting that can be populated by characters that are gradually collected with other Lego Star Wars sets, but already enriched with some unreleased knights and/or one new  \"Transparent-Light-Blue\" minifigure (to act as hologram of a Jedi knight away). The set, with sliding doors mechanically operated, can be enriched with a LEGO Power Functions Light item (ref. 8870) to create glowing pushing buttons.","tag":["star wars","jedi council","jedi","jedi knight","yoda","anakin","old republic","power functions","obi wan"],"status":"Achieved Support","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":8.20682524855025,"concern":0.4152674437830688,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":1000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"74885","project":"b06575ee-1409-4324-a817-d2e99386b9c7","User":"whatpumpkin","Date_project":"Aug 08, 2014","title":"Fossil Museum","description":"Museums are possibly the best way to get a glimpse of just how grand the scale of the Mesozoic world was, save actually being there. Towering skeletons of ancient giants, some with long necks arcing overhead, others shaking their plates at the ceiling, and still others grinning hungrily as they eye their next meal. It is truly an awesome experience to be among the fossilized bones of ancient creatures. This set attempts to capture that magnificent experience in a small display featuring four popular dinosaurs (and one popular pterosaur) in skeletons as accurate as I could achieve at this scale. The genuses are: Stegosaurus Pteranodon Apatosaurus two Deinonychus Spinosaurus Additionally, a paleontologist and a family of three are in the exhibit, to stand in awe at the creatures before them. Five plaques on the exhibit theoretically display the name of the species, though at this scale actually doing so would be difficult. Each dinosaur has a reasonable amount of articulation, if you wish to pose them in your own way when on display, or if you wish to have some dino skeletons duking it out. The skeletons are not white, because from my experience they rarely are. Fossils in museums are usually varying shades of tan and brown, so I did my best to choose the most fitting tone I could. This set has 599 pieces.","tag":["dinosaur","dinosaurs","fossil","museum","skeleton","exhibit","paleontology"],"status":"Achieved Support","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":7.876804381982798,"concern":1.6395369271565872,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":1000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"87051","project":"7a204071-7d33-4cfd-9306-15f1cdbfb798","User":"Swan Dutchman","Date_project":"Dec 01, 2014","title":"Gingerbread House","description":"There are some great sets available to make a Christmas village... and every year there is a new set to expand it.
