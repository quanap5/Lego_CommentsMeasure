I am also working on \"Lego History - Paul Revere and the Midnight Ride\", \"Lego History - Ben Franklin\u0027s Lightning Rod\", \"Lego History - Rosa Parks Gets A Good Seat\", \"Lego History - Battle of Bunker Hill\"  These are all working titles, and there are many more.    I have already build 3 of them, working on them in LDD too. This is my first Lego Idea hopefully of many ABOUT \"Neil Makes is to the Moon\" is made up primarily of all generic pieces.   This would not be a complicated build for anyone.  It is one of my first builds and I look forward to the support of the community.  I do not have any expectations.  Would be nice just to hear a few comments and get a few votes THE LEGO STORY Neil was a very shy boy.  His parents tried to persuade him to play sports and be social with friends at school.  But Neil was a smart kid who enjoyed science and making experiments.  One day while watching TV, Neil saw a show on space exploration and has never been the same.  He spent the rest of his school years studying to be the best astronaut he can be. So today we celebrate as Neil made it to space.

The future is green... The future is armoured... And it sits on 2000 pounds of evil smelling tusked terror! This rider was one of the strongest and meanest in his tribe and has spent its entire life fighting whilst riding the fierce War Boar, which naturally brought the attention of Ugglug the Orc, scourge of Middle Zealand. Having been hand-picked personally by Ugglug himself, and kitted out in the finest armour scavenged from a hundred different battlefields, this Orc is now one of Ugglug\u0027s closest lieutenants, a trusted member of the warband known as Ugglug\u0027s Armoured Orcs. If you see it on the battlefield, beware! Ugglug and the rest of his band are sure to be close at hand. ____________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ DESIGN NOTES Interestingly enough, I\u0027m not the greatest fan when it comes to brick-built animals generally. Consider the amazing shape, quality and articulation of the modern mould of LEGO horses for example and how impossible it would be to re-create that with normal elements. However I came across this initial design four years or so ago, which inspired me to take a look at recreating this classic mount for an Orc warrior. My version has changed quite significantly since then, with at least two major redesigns of the head - allowing for a printed eye as well as the snout and nostrils (which I think is fun as it is particularly boar-y) as well incorporating modifiable saddle accessories and an updated tail section. This has probably sat on my shelf for a good year at least, during which some minor tinkering has taken place, before its eventual inclusion here. A significant addition to the lieutenants were the arrival of ultron sentry officer helmets, which rounds it off really nicely. This set is a nice size for a Polybag (as an introduction to a new fantasy/castle line) and would contain enough extra saddle / boar accessories (chains, weapons and clips) to allow some variation in boar design, but without losing the feel that these troops are definitely an organised unit... at least for Orcs that is! (Particularly if people wanted to make multiple purchases) Even if collectors weren\u0027t especially fans of having an Orc riding the boar, there will be plenty of Lord of the Rings fans that could use the modified boar as a mount for Dáin II Ironfoot from the Battle of the Five Armies Set. As for the final design of the Orc itself, I went for the fantasy era (sand green) Troll warrior as I really like their face. It isn\u0027t too angry or fierce looking like some of the LOTR ones (not that there\u0027s anything wrong with them) but it still has a satisfyingly Orcish expression to it. However I am open for the minifgure design to change - especially since that particular minifigure used is not currently in production (as far as I know). It is, after all, the boar that is the unique and important part of this set.

This set contains six different speeder bikes and their pilots.  Each speeder is unique and has several adjustable wings and cockpits. But how does a speeder bike work?  The principles are rather simple (it is the science that is the hard part).  A speeder bike operates by two methods of thrust (red arrows in the second picture) and then multiple methods of control (blue arrows in the second picture).  Thrust is first pointed down to create lift, and second is pointed back to push the bike forward.  Then the different attached wings and air foils help control and direct the thrust.  And leaves you with a very fast and very maneuverable speeder bike. First, we have the three good guys (third picture).  The leader in white with his two support riders in orange. And second, every good guy must have a bad guy to chase (fourth picture).  So we have our three bad guys to try and escape. Set Details: Six separate builds Six mini-figs 374 total pieces (not including mini-figs) Build time at about 10 minutes per speeder   Vote to support this set.  Thank you.","tag":["speeder","speeder bike","spaceman nathan","space","sci-fi"],"status":"Gathering Support","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":3.7004397181410926,"concern":0.05721836419753087,"no_supporter":38,"no_follower":10,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"133366","project":"8de8c3d6-b8d2-4f00-8ccf-6aab0e76d059","User":"ztoben","Date_project":"Feb 29, 2016","title":"SV1000 Series Box Courier","description":"Next up in my SV1000 chassis series, The SV1000 Box Courier.

The Ultimate Collector\u0027s Edition Voyager 2 Space Probe was built on February 27, 2016, 39 years later. This beautifully crafted set features a high-gain antenna, low-field magnetometer, radioisotope thermoelectric generator, planetary radio astronomy and plasma wave antenna, optical calibration target and radiator, low-energy charged particle, cosmic ray, photopolarimeter, plasma, infrared spectrometer and radiometer, and ultraviolet spectrometer. Usually, this can only be built and experienced by astronomers and scientists, but with a great set like this, anyone can experience the awesomeness of the Voyager 2 space probe!","tag":["Voyager","voyager","2","space","probe","space probe","spacecraft","NASA","nasa space mission","nasa based project","voyager probe","voyager 1","ultimate collector series","ultimate collectors series","ultimate collector set","ultimate collectors"],"status":"Gathering Support","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":2.321928094887362,"concern":0.32199363425925925,"no_supporter":19,"no_follower":6,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"133650","project":"9cae9f3d-efc6-48f4-9c52-de75230c8f9a","User":"Morgrp","Date_project":"Feb 29, 2016","title":"1970 Bond Bug 700ES","description":"Welcome to my 4th Lego Ideas submission, the 1970 Bond Bug 700ES. The Bond Bug is a cult car built by Reliant Cars of Tamworth, England. Launched in 1970 it was in production until 1974.  It was based on the running gear of the Reliant Regal 3 wheeler utilising parts of it\u0027s chassis and much of it\u0027s running gear.  The bond too had just 3 wheels making for some interesting driving characteristics.  It\u0027s 700cc 4 cylinder Reliant engine gave it a top speed of 76mph - plenty for a car of this type! The unusual body was designed by Tom Karen of British design consultancy Ogle Design and fabricated out of fibreglass.  Access into the Bug is via an unusual forward tilting canopy. All Bugs came in striking tangerine orange save for a handful of promotional cars that were finished in white.  This model has been one of the more difficult for me to design.  The complexity of the design was due in part to it\u0027s small dimensions, the forward tilting canopy and including the exposed rear suspension and differential components of the real car. The model features a tilting canopy, weather doors, a detailed interior and the famous 3 wheeled layout. As with all my submissions, Its size fits in well with existing creator models.  The brick count is reasonable and the construction is straight forward. I hope you like it as this one has been a real head scratcher to design at times! Enjoy!
