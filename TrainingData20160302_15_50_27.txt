I am also working on \"Lego History - Paul Revere and the Midnight Ride\", \"Lego History - Ben Franklin\u0027s Lightning Rod\", \"Lego History - Rosa Parks Gets A Good Seat\", \"Lego History - Battle of Bunker Hill\"  These are all working titles, and there are many more.    I have already build 3 of them, working on them in LDD too. This is my first Lego Idea hopefully of many ABOUT \"Neil Makes is to the Moon\" is made up primarily of all generic pieces.   This would not be a complicated build for anyone.  It is one of my first builds and I look forward to the support of the community.  I do not have any expectations.  Would be nice just to hear a few comments and get a few votes THE LEGO STORY Neil was a very shy boy.  His parents tried to persuade him to play sports and be social with friends at school.  But Neil was a smart kid who enjoyed science and making experiments.  One day while watching TV, Neil saw a show on space exploration and has never been the same.  He spent the rest of his school years studying to be the best astronaut he can be. So today we celebrate as Neil made it to space.

I liked the Christmas sets so I built this one on Lego Digital Designer (LDD). I really believe that this model could have a lot of genuine interest to fans of Christmas sets. This is the first of a series of modular buildings that I will be making.   Summary The building consists of roughly 2160 parts and three floors: the main store, office, and lookout. I used the colors brown and sand green that gives it a realistic feeling. Three Mini-figures could be added such as a fisherman, the store keeper, one captain. And a lot of details. It includes: Mini fish, crab, flicking hook, starfish, snow owl, Barrels, If you like this design or the idea of a Old Fishing Store - Modular Building  please support and follow, thanks for reading and Brick On everyone !","tag":["modular","modular building","fishing","sets","christmas","building","store","boat","dock"],"status":"Achieved Support","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":7.84933998668715,"concern":0.13840103832155853,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":1000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"107641","project":"0db0087c-3213-43d3-80d0-cf910ced9d49","User":"jeffach1","Date_project":"Jul 06, 2015","title":"Victorian London Christmas","description":"One of the scenes we most associate with Christmas are the streets of 19th century London on a snowy December day. The sound of carolers, smells the freshly baked goods and laughter of children playing filling the air. This concept is essentially a cross between the modular buildings and the holiday village sets with a Victorian era twist, and would look like something straight out of a Charles Dickens novel.  The design of buildings would have more muted colors than the modern modular sets in order to give them a vintage look. They\u0027ll also use a lot of brick and stone textures and even part a cobble stone road. Rather than just giving all the buildings white roofs and sitting them on a white ground to imply snow, I wanted the snow to look like it was actually sitting on top of the streets and buildings. Walk ways have been shoveled and roof snow has been partially melted off. This gives it a more natural look. On the streets there will be scenes of carolers, the hustle and bustle of holiday shoppers and children playing. The buildings would have store fronts such as a toy store, a bakery or a pub (all featured here). Inside the upper levels there will be  classic holiday scenes like: opeing presents, preparing holiday dinner, singing to the piano, etc...    This is a fairly large piece so it might have to simplified to be realistic as a single set. Perhaps removing one of the buildings, or reducing the number of floors. ","tag":["holiday","christmas","london","vintage","snow","winter","old","horse","Britain","England","Victorian","historical","19th century","december"],"status":"In Review","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":8.402164130866586,"concern":0.3945742895222062,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":2000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"98263","project":"df74e9e6-183c-4cf5-a2f5-41e0b8626260","User":"lostsleep","Date_project":"Mar 18, 2015","title":"The Golden Girls Living Room and Kitchen Modular Set with Dorothy, Rose, Blanche, Sophia, and Stan","description":"This is a recreation of the Golden Girls House used in filming the popular 1980\u0027s show that is still watched daily around the world.   It is the Foyer, Living Room, and Kitchen built like a TV set, with one wall removed and a full view into the space.  It comes with 5 minifigures including Dorothy, Rose, Sophia, Blanche, and Stanley.  It has been meticulously recreated to have opening cupboards and fridge in the kitchen, Wicker Sofa and Chairs, a hallway backdrop, a storage closet in the kitchen, and an outdoor area with potted plants and a hose.

LEGO Cuusoo will now consider LEGO Doctor Who ideas. More LEGO photos of my set will be posted on my website HERE You Tube video showing Tardis unfold and interior The iconic Tardis sits where it all began, Totters Lane. The scene is a typical London street, with brick wall/fencing and lamp post with Totters Lane sign. The Doctor and his companion stand outside with K9 ready for adventures. The Tardis opens up to become the inner Tardis walls and can be placed next to the console where the Doctor controls their journey through time. The set includes: Tardis, exterior / interior walls. (LEGO if you don\u0027t want to use the frame and \"glass\" part of my Tardis design that\u0027s ok) Interior console ( LEGO can choose if they want the full, console and tilt damage ) street/Interior base. K9 (18 parts) 1 Dalek red, or gray (25 parts) (assuming Lego can get the license) Minifigs (most have dual printed face, happy and shocked ) 1 and possibly 2 Doctors. An older and more recent Doctor, so older and younger fans have a Doctor. For the more recent Doctor, I propose Tennant, or maybe Capaldi, who is the latest incarnation. For the other I propose the 4th Doctor Tom Baker, and possibly Sara Jane as his companion. I am open for LEGO to choose the Doctor/s 2 Companions (Rose Tyler if Tennant is chosen, or Clara Oswald if Capaldi is chosen. (Possiblility of 1) Weeping Angel (Face printed on both sides) (Possiblility of 1) Cyberman If LEGO likes the idea, a sound brick for the iconic Tardis sound. Due to the nature of the set fans may buy 2 sets. One to have the Tardis on the street scene, and another to have the Tardis unfolded to become the inner walls placed next to console. Total part count including Minifigs around 530 (less if just the top of the console is chosen) LEGO I will supply you with the Ldd file. If you choose this I am open to you, and fans choosing which Doctor/s. And choosing if you want only certain parts of the design/ Minifigures. Be warned which way you turn, sometimes, it\u0027s a choice between becoming a rock and a hard place, as the Weeping Angel may turn you to stone, or the Dalek exterminate you! Figures have dual sided printed facial expressions. Real photos of Lego, with contrast adjustment in Photoshop, and Laser fire! Not sure look HERE Tom\u0027s scarf works with an existing LEGO part, but with a scarf printed on it. The shade and cloth folds, and waviness details are built into the printed color. The scarf being a part is also removable. BOX ART: I think fans may geek out if the Box was a front view photo, or render of the Iconic LEGO Tardis. The top left window could be the LEGO logo, and below that the white rectangle could have text saying the set number, part count etc. The box doors could open showing photos of the set. I think this would appeal more to Who fans, stand out on store shelves, and make the set more unique and collectible. LEGO did a similar thing with the 4x4 Crawler Exclusive Edition. The set could have a small pamphlet with details on Doctor Who and it\u0027s history. Thank you for your support, and consideration.","tag":["Doctor Who","Sci Fi","Micro","Minifigures","Tardis","K9","Science","Dr who","Dr","lego Doctor Who"],"status":"On Shelves","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":6.430870889416485,"concern":0.20015948798500882,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":1000,"no_expert_comment":0},{"proj":"96133","project":"fe2aa9ed-e0c4-4bf1-aa09-8d54dfd6b094","User":"alexander2184","Date_project":"Mar 02, 2015","title":"Grandpa Greg","description":"Grandpa Greg and his scooter The set includes one minifigure; grandpa Greg.
