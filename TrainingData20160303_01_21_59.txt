Who will decide the fate of the galaxy? You will. Build your lightsaber, choose your side... This set captures the iconic form of Darth Vader\u0027s and Luke Skywalker\u0027s Return of the Jedi lightsabers in brick-built Lego form. My idea is to allow us mere humans not in that galaxy far, far away to participate in the age-old Jedi and Sith tradition of completing our skills and building by offering a set that allows us to build two of the most iconic lightsabers in the Star Wars universe. Just like the \"real thing\" each lightsaber has a crystal inside. These lightsabers are sturdy enough to withstand being handled and sturdy enough to support the blade concept. Furthermore, I want to make these hilts as realistic as possible to pass off as a prop for a costume (for people who are into that sort of thing)...they can take the abuse of a convention crowd! I proudly showed these off at Megacon 2013. UPDATES 13 December 2013: Based on the new project guidelines, this set has evolved into a stand alone set that includes two iconic lightsabers of the Star Wars Universe and the movie Return of the Jedi...Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. Based on your feedback, these are the two lightsabers you have expressed the most interest in, and these are the lightsabers I have decided to go forward with. Find this project on Facebook! You can see more pictures of lightsaber concepts that aren\u0027t related to this project here on Flickr This set include a Luke and Vader minifigure, two brick built lightsabers, and a display stand. Each lightsaber has a crystal inside of it! Blade concept! Each lightsaber is designed to have a brick built blade attach to the hilt.

Everyone who has been asking for a RED ROBIN check out our new project-Red Robin \u0026 Alfred: Gates to Wayne Manor Rogue\u0027s \"Gallery\" For the first two months of this project we sought feedback from the fans on which characters you would like to \"Assault\" Wayne Manor. We have received over 800 votes and after much discussion we have locked down our proposed cadre of villainy for this set. Our proposal will include: Ra\u0027s al Ghul Red Hood (Jason Todd) Firefly We have integrated our character models through the project art but you can also view them on our campaign page. We hope they meet with your satisfaction. The Selection- Ra\u0027s al Ghul and Red Hood are excellent characters to include in a set depicting Wayne Manor. They are of but a small hand-full of nefarious characters that know Batman\u0027s alter ego as Bruce Wayne. Their depth of character and complex histories with Batman also speak well to the goal here of showcasing and celebrating the extremely wide and divergent history of the Detective over a variety of media and decades of story telling in a singular set. Firefly is likely a bit of a ringer for most people. Firefly is in fact an excellent choice. Of all of the villains the Batman might encounter, Firefly is likely the greatest threat to Wayne Manor itself...besides, using Firefly in a set will give new purpose to all those Lego firefighters we Lego fans have. So, what next...well, we have the start of a story, a story about an Assault on Wayne manor. We are investigating the best way to do this right now, and it is a daunting and challenging task, but that is what Cuusoo is all about, setting your sights high :) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ DC Comics Campaign The single greatest thing that could happen to this project would be a posting on an official Batman page. So if you really want this to happen, please consider contacting DC comics directly here. Here is a message you can send them about our project. Hopefully if enough people will send it in, they will post it to Facebook and Twitter! \"Hello DC comics! There is a fan campaign to create a Lego Wayne Manor ( https://ideas.lego.com/projects/50007 ). At a lifetime average of more than 45 support per day, this is the fastest growing project on Lego Cuusoo! It only needs 8000 more votes for Lego to review it. We realize that getting a set produced is a long shot, but please consider sharing this project with true Batman fans via your facebook and twitter feeds to help us get this project to the review phase and celebrate this homage to the world greatest detective.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Please, we cannot stress this enough, if you like this project tell your friends, family, and other Batfans about it! If every person who has supported this project so far got just 4 more people to support it, we would already be at 10,000 votes! Thank you :) There are plenty of Batman sets on Cuusoo, and plenty of Modulars but this is something new, something different, a themed Modular, Wayne Manor. A theme is not the only thing that makes this modular unique though. Instead of stacking, this model unfolds. The folding method allows for multiple levels of display AND play. Folded up the build is an attractive manor, but there are three hinges dividing the model into four quarters. These can be arranged for the previously indicated closed display, all hinges open (as displayed above) or a variety of other configurations. *************** For those new to Cuusoo, Welcome! Cuusoo is a site where people can vote for projects to become real Lego products. All we need it 10,000 votes to get reviewed! We need your help to get there though. If you like this project, please help spread the word on social media. Here is a brief article on other ways you can help this project become a reality. ************* Thank You! The Response has been Phenomenal! We thank each and every one of you. There is no way this list could be complete but we wanted to point out some great help we have received from the project’s fans that have really helped to get the word out: David Willis, Creator of Shortpacked Scott Snyder , CURRENT WRITER OF BATMAN! iFanboy, the very best podcast on Comic Books out there All Star Comics: “A vote for Wayne Manor is a vote for AWESOME!” ************* Please \"Like\" the Rebrick images to help get them out to Lego fans everywhere: Image 1DetailsImage 2Image 3Image 4* ************** \"Ra\u0027s al Ghul\" Ra is presented here in his most classic style: A gentleman of refinement bedecked is not only a suit but ALSO a cape (refinement squared). Ra comes armed with a large scimitar. \"Bruce Wayne\" \"Plain Cloths\" super heroes are uncommon in production Lego sets. This is likely in part to how easy it is to make them out of regular figure parts. We believe however that a Bruce Wayne figure is essential to a \"Wayne Manor\" build as he is the titular character. \"Alfred Pennyworth\" When building a Wayne Manor, there is no element more critical. Alfred is the foundation upon which the Manor stands (that and four 16x16 baseplates) Above is the finely appointed main room of Wayne Manor. The bookcase opens to grant access to... ...the Batcave! The \"central\" quarters of the build are dedicated to the bat-computer and a removable holding cell. \"Batgirl\" So, who to round out our quartet? Robin is the easy answer, but we wanted to go with something a little different. Part of the goal of this project is to celebrate our love of the entire continuity of Batman. Since her introduction in the 60\u0027s, few characters of the extended Batfamily have been as consistent as Barbra Gordon / Batgirl. Batman fans of every make and media have familiarity with her and or her uniform. Barbra Gordon is even in the Batman Beyond animated series. As part of Cuusoo we also want to do our part to encourage more super heroines in official Lego products. To date we have only received two super heroines (Wonder Woman and Black Widow) and only in two sets. \"Lucius Fox\" If we are to showcase both Bruce Wayne and Batman in a single set, the inclusion of Lucius Fox is simply put, a no brainer. Logistically, and in nearly every incarnation of the Batman stories, Lucius is the brains behind the continuing success of Wayne Enterprises, its business manager, freeing up Batman to pursue his ultimate goal. Lucius is one of the extremely few, non-vigilante, characters in the DC universe who is a true friend to Bruce Wayne. To top it off, in many of the Batman continuities, Lucius is not only a monetary mastermind but also the project manger if not actual inventor of many of Batman\u0027s gear answering the question, \"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\" \"Red Hood\" Red Hood is presented as inspired by his original character design. As his Hood is very form fitting we propose printing directly on a red head piece, just as with a Bane or Spider-man figure. \"Firefly\" This was a very fun character to design. We pulled aspects from the Animated Series as well as more modern takes on the character. Firefly comes with a \"jet pack\" that has wings that fold up when not in use, a short flame thrower, and a flaming sword. \"Batman\" If nothing else this figure would be included as the suit stored in the Batcave. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The \"left\" quarter of the batcave is dedicated to Batman\u0027s infamous trophies: The T-rex The Joker Card The Giant Penny Mr. Freeze\u0027s gun Green Kryptonite the \"right\" quarter of the batcave showcases Batman\u0027s equipment including a chamber for his suit. Wayne Manor would not be complete without secret passages. There is the above mentioned bookcase-batcave entrance, but there is also escape hatches under the statuary and a collapsing staircase. More Heroes/Villains!!! (Robin, Robin 2, Robin 3+, Nightwing, Ace the Bat-Hound, Batmite, Talia, Huntress, Hush, etc..) Any set, regardless of scale, must contain a finite number of figures. We understand that every fan of Batman has their own preferences on who should be in set and we totally respect that. Please also realize that we have picked the line up we have choose with the same care and respect for the franchise that we applied to every brick of the Wayne Manor. This roster is however, just a proposal. The core of this project is the Manor. If Lego and Warner Brothers, in their infinite wisdom decide to go with a different allotment of characters then we gladly accept this. If you really don\u0027t care for our line up though, we are not the people you need to be informing, you need to tell Lego directly. How do you do that? Well, first you need to write in such requests in the feedback during the \"Support\" process. Second, and even more important, we need to get this project to 10,000 as quickly as possible. The faster we get to 10,000 the more likely this set is to get produced, and the stronger the case will be for more figures. So please, do your part and share this project with as many people as you can. This means telling your friends, telling your family, tweeting about it to followers and comic-related accounts, posting on forums, facebook, google+, pinning it to pintrest, voting for it on reddit, etc...Every vote counts. **************** Check out the References included to Batman / Bruce Wayne in the Mansion here. • General References -2 x 2 tile depicting cover to Detective Comics #27 -Grandfather Clock, Often an entrance to the Batcave.

The real question is, can the market meet the asking price? Well, that is very hard for us to predict ahead of time. We are shooting for the moon and seeing what falls out. Maybe we get the whole thing, maybe we get a smaller model, maybe we all just get to have fun thinking how cool it would be to have this sucker. Can We get an oversized figure like the Lego Hulk? This type of figure is called a \"big-fig\" In Lego circles. Such a figure requires the creation of new Lego parts and it therefore not something we can officially request though a Cuusoo project. Can you add/subtract \"this\" to the Wayne Manor? We love the interest and feedback on what elements the project should contain. Keep them coming! For the most part though, Lego is fundamentally AWESOME. One of the ways it is awesome is in its infinite customability. Think about this set as a template, a base structure for your ideal Wayne Manor. Once this set is in your hands, you can reconfigure it any way you choose. How many Parts are In this build? To clarify, The depicted build is simply a proposal. Lego will produce the final model based on this proposal, therefore the exact part count of this build is not significant to the project. However, the part count for Lego Modulars range from 2000 to 2800 pieces. Can I please have the instructions / LDD file? We truly appreciate the interest in building the Wayne Manor. It is the highest compliment a designer can receive. At this time however, we are reserving any decisions about releasing the instructions until the review is complete. Where is the Batmobile? We wanted this Batcave to fit in the footprint of the Lego Modular and this pretty much prevented us from including a Batmobile or an awesome turntable or break away wall for it drive through. Additionally, Lego has many Batman vehilces already produced and we saw no reason to retread on this ground. As you can see though, the Batcave continues...The Left and Right quarters have open passages that you can build off of. The Batmobile could simply be in the \"foreground\" of this build. Part of the awesomeness of Lego is that if you want your Wayne Manor to have the Batmobile, simply build your own (or buy one of Lego\u0027s existing sets) and build it out. * How did you make the Portrait of the Wayne\u0027s There was some photoshopping involved but the source images mostly came from a app called Mini Mi I highly recommend it for quick figure design. *************** This project is brought to you by DarthKy and Glenbricker DarthKy specializes in a variety of Brick Built Figures based on popular characters.

A 2.4-meter (7.9 ft) aperture telescope in low Earth orbit, Hubble\u0027s four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared. The telescope is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble. Hubble\u0027s orbit outside the distortion of Earth\u0027s atmosphere allows it to take extremely high-resolution images with almost no background light. Hubble\u0027s Deep Field has recorded some of the most detailed visible-light images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the universe. Although not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy. The HST was built by the United States space agency NASA, with contributions from the European Space Agency, and is operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute. The HST is one of NASA\u0027s Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. If you are wondering how I made it round, well... let\u0027s say it took a lot of \"technic\" parts and a lot of creativity.

Daft Punk have appeared in \"Tron\" and in their own movie \"Electroma,\" their distinct visual style is clearly appealing to fans of Sci-Fi, which to me speaks to their \"playability.\" Much of Lego\u0027s success has come from Space and other Sci-Fi/Fantasy lines. Daft Punk should fit right in with such lines. Space Police running security at a Daft Punk show on some alien planet? Daft Punk rescued by the Galaxy Patrol? Daft Punk abducted from earth during their ALIVE tour? Endless possibilities? The style and tone of Daft Punk aligns perfectly with Lego and would create an experience that people of all ages can enjoy. With this I propose a Daft Punk set, that would introduce the Robots to Lego\u0027s world as minifigures. The set should include instruments (as pictured, maybe turntables, sequencers, mixers, controllers and a guitar for robot rocking), a simple stage with simple lighting and speakers. Having the Robot Helmets and some new printed tiles with instruments would open the door to all the custom options. Fan\u0027s could build their Daft Punk set into larger creations, like one\u0027s own Lego City, or some of the other things I mentioned above. The photos I will continue to post are meant to serve as a representation of the set\u0027s playability, different minifig torsos can and should be subbed in and out to create different Daft Punk appearances, lighting and stages should be expanded, etc. Also important to note is that my robot minifigs are sporting helmets that are as close as what Lego makes to the real deal. I would prefer to have custom printed visors for these guys, Thomas\u0027s helmet should have the all black visor with printing that says something Daft Punky in LED\u0027s, and Guy\u0027s will retain the visor from my images but could maybe have some printing as well. I will make an image soon showing what I mean. Update: May 13 - We have reached over 100 supporters in just a few days, making the #9 spot on the most supported projects. Thank you for supporting. May 19 - New Pic! New robot helmet! So I have added an alternate concept for Thomas\u0027 helmet, Though I would like to express again, when this is made, it will look exactly like the real thing, as I am proposing new minifig pieces be made for this set. May 20 - Now the #5 spot on most supported projects. Thank you supporters. More photos coming soon. October 24 - Finally new pics of the LED lit pyramid stage, and new outfits for the guys. We managed to clinch the #3 spot last week on the top ten and we are now at 1500 supporters. Thanks everybody. December 2 - Changed main image as per the advice of supporters, almost to 2,000. lets get there before the new year? Also...#2 spot on the most supported! Thanks so much, this is as high up on the list as we\u0027ve gotten. December 7 - Updated the Description to be more clear. We\u0027re over 2,000 supporters.

Hopefully if enough people will send it in, they will post it to Facebook and Twitter! ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………. \"Hello Marvel comics! There is a fan campaign to create a Lego X-Mansion (https://ideas.lego.com/projects/53799 ). It needs only 10,000 votes for Lego to review it. We realize that getting a set produced is a long shot, but please consider sharing this project with X-men fans via your facebook and twitter feeds to help us get this project to the review phase and celebrate our love of the X-Men.\" ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………. Please also share this project with any other individuals or organization you think might appreciate it. Interior Details. The intent of this project is to campaign Lego and Marvel to produce a Lego set worthy of representing one of the most famous institutions in the history of Comic Books, the X-Mansion Like our previous project Assault on Wayne Manor we decided to go with the Lego Modular footprint, but again, with a twist. When this model is closed in the “storage” it remains a handsome display while taking up a minimum footprint. However, the sides of this modular fold open along a vertical axis creating the distinctive wings to the classic X-mansion. We will be the first to say that this set is extreme with no less than four stories. Our proposal includes (starting from the bottom left of the image): • Cerebro / Danger Room Observation Deck •The Danger Room •Situation/Computer Room •First floor Staircase •Main Lobby •Laboratory/Medical Bay •Second Story Staircase •Classroom •Headmaster’s Office •Top Story Staircase •Storm’s Attic Garden •Dorm Room ___________ Included Figures Ok, if you were paying attention to the picture above, there are many characters depicted, 45 to be exact. This project will NOT include 45 X-men. This proposal is first and foremost to produce the X-mansion. Of course, everyone has their favorite cadre of X-men and sadly we will not be able to include them all in a single set. What we propose is to include a bare handful of critical figures and leave it to Lego, Marvel, and voter feedback to figure out the rest. Proposed Characters: Xavier: He is the founder of the school of course. We propose that he be presented in the levitating chair as depicted. Beast: Beast is foundational character. Very well liked and his intellect and physicality allows him to server in a variety of display and play roles. Shadowcat: Another very well liked character that is suitable for a multitude of roles. She is also a critical character in a variety of X-men events. She is also GlenBricker’s (one of the co-creators of this project) favorite X-man. Gambit: Gambit is a lot of fun. One of the contrarians of this diverse family. He is also DarthKy’s (the other co-creator) favorite X-man. Mystique: This is fundamentally the home of the X-men. The more blunt foes of the X-men would not be well suited to the concept of the set. Mystique however is an expert of infiltration and suits very well with the premise. Storm and Cyclops (Not inherently Included): It is hard to imagine the X-mansion without at least one of these character’s being included. When we initially started this project they were both required characters. However it has now been revealed that Lego will be producing these characters. That of course does not mean that they cannot be included. We just no longer feel the need to push for them as they will be in the collective of existing Lego characters, like Wolverine. The Rest? It is very hard to assess which other characters should be included or how many at that. For that reason we are leaving the rest up to Lego, Marvel, and You. When you vote for this project make sure to tell Lego who you want included. Also, we have a poll on our X-Mansion Campaign Page for you to vote for your favorite X-men The highest voted character’s may not get picked but its more data for Lego and Marvel to process. As for how many will be included, well that is up to you as well. When you support this project, you will be asked how much you would be willing to pay for a set based on this project. Of course, your instinct will be to say $1. Well, if everyone says that the project either won’t get produced, OR we will end up with a set worth $1. To be blunt, the more you are willing to pay for the set, the more content it will include. Although we are very open as to the exact characters in the final roster, it is important to us that it includes an equal (plus or minus one) number of female and male characters. We know that this will not be difficult to accomplish as the overall roster of X-men characters. Please note, on our journey to 10,000 supporters we may find the need to change up the proposed roster. We give you our assurance that though we reserve the right to do so, we will only do so with great consideration. ********************* Your Feedback in the Comments: Avoiding the “unexplained should.” ********************* We are expecting a lot of people to comment on which characters “should” be in this set. We encourage you to give your feedback but please, elaborate! The simple statement “Beak should be in this set.” is bland and lets face it, unconvincing. There have been over 100 “official” X-men since the comic debuted in 1963, and this is ONE SET. So, please, be creative, make a case! -------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Danger Room With perhaps the exception of cerebro, there is nothing more iconically associated with the residence of the X-men as the Danger Room. That is why the Danger Room is the largest element of our design. This is where the students come to train and hone their skills, an environment that is simultaneously safe and extremely deadly. Now, as any real fan of the X-men knows, the Danger Room can mimic any environment required to test the mettle of the X-men. Such a task is beyond the scope of even the most expansive Lego set. Should this reach production we would encourage fans to use their own Lego collections in creating truly diverse environments. We have however attempted to portray the Danger room in its default state. Metallic walls that are ready to spring traps and obstacles that would challenge even Omega Level mutants. We have included a variety of classic elements: a combat robot, grappling arms, rods and rings, crushing walls, and dart throwers. Not displayed are also a series of flame throwers and beam weapons. We have designed the Danger Room to use 6 stud x 6 stud x 6 stud architecture to allow for modular layout and easy customization. Nearly every element can be readily reconfigured and the standard layout allows for easy customization. In addition to this standard “obstacle footprint” the other design innovation we propose is “holographic villains.” We would like the set to include a series of clear 1 x 5 x 6 bricks with prints of classic X-men villains depicted on them. This invokes the holographic nature of the Danger Room while also allowing the set to include references to all of our favorite X-foes while not ramping up the cost of the set. The image above depicts Juggernaut and Magneto versions of these “holographic villains.” -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Other Rooms Cuusoo only allows us to show five images in a project. For that reason we will be cycling out the following images over time to showcase various rooms and character concepts. As we cycle through images they will be moved to the campaign page (link later). If you would like to be kept abreast of changes to the project, you can follow us on Twitter or our flickr page Rooms on the X-Mansion Campaign Page: Cerebro/Danger Room Observation Deck -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Laboratory / Medical Bay As we all know, a lot of X-men stories eventually require a laboratory, often being operated by Doctor Hank McCoy, The Beast. We have populated this room with a series of “high tech” panels and a collection of minifig scaled equipment including a microscope. The board on the wall depicts a DNA chain and an “adamantium skeleton with claws” (what could that be?). A bar hangs down from the ceiling so that the Beast can perform his iconic pose of “sciencing inverted.” Also central to the room is a posable scanning/recuperation bed with monitors. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Xavier’s Office The Headmaster’s (Xavier’s) office includes integrates a bookcase and candle sconces into the walls. Central to the build is a fine well snotted (link to snotted) desk with a lamp, mug, and a “chess set.” The figure depicted is a proposal for the Shadowcat. As we stated above, she is sporting the iconic Yellow and Black of the X-men. Thus, such a figure could be easily modified to stand in for a multitude of other X-men characters. ____________ FAQ Can We get an over-sized figure Colossus or Juggernaut, like the Lego Hulk? This type of figure is called a \"big-fig\" In Lego circles. Such a figure requires the creation of new Lego parts and it therefore not something we can officially request though a Cuusoo project. Isn\u0027t this a bit big? There have been been larger Lego sets to be sure but yes, it is very large. The real question is, can the market meet the asking price? Well, that is very hard for us to predict ahead of time. We are shooting for the moon and seeing what falls out. Maybe we get the whole thing, maybe we get a smaller model, perhaps we just get the Danger Room, maybe we all just get to have fun thinking how cool it would be to have this sucker. If nothing else, we are showcasing to Lego and Marvel just how big the demand is for these characters. Why don\u0027t you split this up into a series of sets? Cuusoo prohibits projects that directly promote a series of sets. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you for taking the time to look at (and hopefully support) our project.

Get ready to face the toughest bosses with the wise King of Red Lions as your guide! UPDATE 9/16/13 New cover. Render by Glenbricker\u0027s Review MAJOR UPDATE: 8/16/13 I have given this set another facelift, this time expanding the island and creating an enemy for the King of Red Lions with the warship. The set would now be 576 pieces, probably in the $40-$45 price range. Playability features: 1) The King of Red Lions sail is moveable and his head can be turned and placed in a variety of positions. The sail can be swapped out for the cannon (non-firing). 2)There is an enemy warship to battle. 3) Link can fight the Chu-chu jellies on the island. Also, the rock can be removed to revealing a hole that leads to secret chamber where. Link must then battle the spiders to retrieve the treasure. The chamber is accessible via a hinge. UPDATE 2/13/13 I have given this set a reworking. I have updated the boat and the island and I have created a far more accurate Link. This set has 205 pieces. At this piece count, this set would probably be in the $20-$25 price range. Playability features: 1) The King of Red Lions sail is moveable and his head can be turned and placed in a variety of positions. 2) The tree can be \"chopped\" as in the game. I think the set works as a stand alone set but a line could certainly be expanded from this. The set - 576 pieces. The boat has been altered for accuracy and it\u0027s a bit bigger in the middle. The island has been reduced quite a bit to bring down the piece count and to appear more \"LEGO\". The Chu-chu has been redesigned slightly.

The siege of Minas Tirith, as seen in \"The Return of the King,\" is an iconic scene from the world of Tolkien that TLG has not yet covered with their products. I believe this is a critical scene that deserves to be made, and as I think I have showcased above, the set can exist at a manageable size, with plenty of figures and play features, while maintaining its signature appearance. As you can see, a modular design would make Minas Tirith more manageable to build, store, and play with. The different curtains of the city are held in place when assembled by spacer bricks on the ground. The white city is filled with fun features and detailed interiors. Some rooms include the library, the throne room, the catacombs, and a kitchen cellar. Of course, a Mordor Orc Army would make an excellent battle-builder set, something like the Uruk Hai Army set from the first wave of Lord of the Rings sets. The rubber-band powered catapult throws the spheres. The trebuchets on the city walls are also fully functional. Imposing, no? Wouldn\u0027t you want to have one of these in your collection? I sure would, and I don\u0027t think there are many LEGO Lord of the Rings fans who could say no to a set like this!

Designing the helicarrier with Lego was quite challenging and it took me a while to complete the job.  Based upon two dimensional pictures, I tried to measure the proportions of the helicarrier as accurate as I could. And then, I converted them with Stud to design the ship with Lego. By reviewing the still images and other pictures, I did my best to design the ship as similar as the one in the movie. As it was almost impossible to express the underside of the helicarrier with Lego, I modified it a little bit. The total span of the ship was about 217 x 115 cm (\u003d 85.4 x 45.3 inches) and a total of 22,694 bricks were used. The basic frame was made with Technic brick and Connector Peg. I used SNOT (Stud Not On Top) method to form the exterior of the ship with SNOT-outs and SNOT-ins. As it was done on LDD and SNOT method was used a little too much, a few modifications might be need for a real model. In addition, durability has to be strengthened.

In 2015, the Goonies will be 30 years old, so what better time than now to start a Cuusoo campaign to reignite Lego’s interest in this franchise in time for the celberation? With the success of the Back to the Future set, and Ghostbusters in review with Cuusoo, there\u0027s definately enough interest in retro movies from the 80\u0027s to warrent this. My campaign offers up all our favourite characters in Mini-Figure form, as well as concepts for several interconnecting sets, which will help kids (and adults) to re-enact the story from start to finish. The other sets will appear in different campaigns. In regards to Lego’s brand standards,The Goonies very much fits into the ethics that Lego believe in. It’s fun, exciting and offers many possibilities for expansion. It is also very reminiscent of other existing Lego licensed products such as Indiana Jones and Harry Potter, and just like everyone’s favourite wizard. Everything is centred on children as the main protagonists. It also has the added appeal of being a nostalgic setpiece that the older collectors of Lego will cherish. This set is based on the finale of the Goonies Movie, where the kids finally find the treasure. When I created this set, I looked at some of the existing Lego Pirate sets out there. I thought the Pirates of the Carribean set \u0027The Black Pearl\u0027 was very similar to the Inferno so I used a lot of the design aspects from that to create this. What I didnt like about the Black Pearl set tho was that it was basically just one deck. So I have restructured the design and the Inferno is taller, and has 2 decks. You can lift part of the top deck up and there is a playset underneath, with cannons and skeletons littered about. The cabin to the rear of the ship is also bigger than the Black Pearl and opens up to reveal the dead pirate One Eyed Willy sat at his table covered in treasures. I have also added the dreaded \u0027plank\u0027 that the Goonies have to walk, and for fun, I added a crows nest for extra playability. Surrounding the ship are jagged rocks, and for the harcore fans, I\u0027ve added the infamous \u0027Octopus\u0027 from one of the deleted scenes. This is probably the \u0027big\u0027 set in the series, so I would have all the minifigures in this one. Chunk (no....Captain Chunk!!)

Oook. Oook! Translation: Just past 3000 supporters and I am thrilled to update this project with a build of Death and his trusty steed Binky. This has been a long time coming, sorry for the delays. I should not take anywhere near as long to get to Granny but I want quite badly to represent the character with quality and with respect for the many Discworld fans that Love these characters so much. Cheers! ************** REQUEST FOR FEEDBACK Granny Weatherwax is the next and final character I intend to include with this project. As with all the previous characters I want to build a small vignette to go with the character...but I am having some difficulty nailing down how to present Granny. I know she will have You but things get sketchy after that. If you (not You) have any ideas for a small Granny Weatherwax vignette please feel free to share them in the comments. ************** 3 Years Plus before the Review!!! But you can change that! This is a campaign to make a Lego set based off of the Discworld. In order for that to happen, We need to get this project to 10,000 supporters. At Current levels of support, that day will not come for 3 years, possibly longer. I know that fans are out there and in the numbers to get this to 10k. I would like to make clear that Supporting this project is not a declaration of intent to future purchase but a desire to see the concept reviewed by The Lego Group for production. Registering and supporting only takes a few minutes, less if you use your Facebook or twitter account. Please make sure you register THEN support though. If you try to support without registering first, the vote does not count. ************** What is all this about then? This is a campaign to produce an official Discworld Lego set. Producing fan conceived Lego sets is the point of Cuusoo. Projects really only have a shot at getting produced if they \"go viral\" to some extent. So please consider tweeting the project (and tweet again a few days later to pick up stragglers!), sharing on Facebook, directly contact esteemed individuals (like Sacharissa Cripslock) an webpages that are cool enough to talk about the Discworld, and send it up every Clack tower you can find. Even use one of Moist von Lipwig new fangled stamps....of course, a campaign to create such a Lego set would be so awesome and unpredictable that we really should avoid bringing it to the attention of the Auditors of Reality, so do your best to keep them from finding out. ************** What is Discworld? IF you already know and love Discworld, you can jump down to the next image...otherwise keep reading for a description of what Discworld is.... Congratulations, you have now discovered Discworld! It is an ongoing series of books (and multimedia extravaganza!) by Sir Terry Pratchett and it is quite simply one of the greatest literary continuums off all time. The setting of the series, (as the name implies) is disc that is balanced on four elephants which are, in turn, on the back of a giant turtle, the Great A\u0027Tuin. The books are inspired by our own history, literary classics of ALL breeds, mythology, and the ever confounding human condition. The stories, while rooted in the fantastic use wry wit and cunning satire to tell very compelling narratives while also reflect real world issues, without ever getting to heavy. The Discworld has spawned no less than: 39+ Novels (70 million copies sold in 37 languages) 3 Movies 4 Graphic Novels 6 Video Games 2 RPG supplements 1 Cook Book More detailed information about the credentials of the series can be found here. A lot more details about the narrative and fiction of Discworld can be found here. Quite frankly I suggest the books to anyone who enjoys...well, anything really. Any that goes double for those who DON\u0027T like anything. ************** So what to build to do the Discworld series justice? I decided to try to recreate some of Bergholt Stuttley Johnson\u0027s work but I kept running out of Octarine colored bricks and the little imp just kept refusing to make any pictures of it in order to preserve its own sanity. Failing that I thought long and hard about how to best represent my love of the Discworld series in Lego form. I considered attempting to build various structures described, like the Unseen University or the Treacle Mine Road Watch House, in the series but found that each one was not significant enough to embrace the scope of the series...Rincewind, The City Watch, The Witches, the Wizards, Death, Tiffany Aching, Moist von Lipwig. For a while I considered doing The Kite and its Crew. In the end though, Cuusoo will only produce one set for any project submitted. So I have decided to go with the Whole Thing. But I have added a micro build of the The Kite (see the next last picture). In addition, I plan on creating a small collection of figures that, like the Discworld\u0027s elephants, form the foundation of nearly all the stories of the Disc: Rincewind, Granny Weatherwax, Sam Vimes, and Death. In addition I will be including a personal favorite of mine, the Librarian. Excluding Death, I do believe he is in the most books...except perhaps C,M.O.T.D. I considered adding Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler but he was charging too much for his likeness, and his sausages make me sick. Over the following weeks I will be adding my custom renderings of these figures to the project. I want to take my time and do them the justice they deserve. So check in from time to time for updates, or you can follow me on twitter, @glenbricker. ************** A Little More Serious Many of you are likely aware that Terry Pratchett has early onset Alzheimer\u0027s. As of 2010, there are an estimated 35.6 million people with Alzheimer\u0027s worldwide and the number is expected to double every 20 years. As the creator of this Cuusoo project, if this reaches production I will receive a small portion of the profits from the sale of the resulting set. I will donate 50% of any profits I may receive from this project to Alzheimer\u0027s research. ************** \"Interesting\" tidbit for Lego hardcore fans. The Turtle shell and flipper are built 45 degrees off the standard, that is to say the disc and the, Turtle head are 45 degrees off from the body of the turtle. This allows the Elephants to be seated quite firmly even though they are odd angles. The Disc and Elephants a place out with \"Lego geometry\" to get point of contact that match despite this odd orientation. *************** Special thanks to Alatariel Alatariel tweeked my elephants design from \"cool\" to \"awesome.\" I think she could only have made them better with bow ties and a fez. If you like the elephants even a little bit I must recommend that you check out her projects: Female Minifigure Set - MegaMan Project - THE FIGURES What you see above is the final proposal of the Librarian and Sam Vimes vignettes. The Librarian image is based on a Paul Kidby image from The Last Hero. Click here to see a comparison picture (Cuusoo only lets me put 5 pictures up) Some of you may think the minifig looks agry...well sometimes the Librarian is angry. That is not the intent though. I will work on it a bit. Sam Vimes is also based on a Paul Kidby image. Click here to see a comparison picture and the street light (shown in the top image) is based on those seen in the Discworld movie \"Going Postal.\" My plan is to release the figures as I get them designed. One at a time. I would rather show you these silhouettes now and let your imagination take over than show a sub-par printing. Regardless of the quality of my designs though, if this project reaches production, a TRUE Lego artist will design the final production figures, so you should judge the concept more on the quality you have come to expect out of Lego minifigs than anything I produce. I have been toying with the idea of including a Terry Pratchett figure. If I could only have one figure I would probably go with Pratchett. I have also considered having Terry Pratchett instead of the Librarian. One of the big things keeping me from doing it is that a Terry Pratchett figure is pretty easy to make. You just take Sean Connery\u0027s head and put it on Shia LaBeouf\u0027s body then add a Black fedora. That is not something I ever imagined saying before. You might want to swap out the pants for black ones though. The other reason is I am not sure he would care for it. If he wants one though, he gets one, even if I have to make it myself. I would love to include EVERY character from Discworld but Cuusoo projects still have to remain with the limits of reason to get produced. So, my selection here is based on the idea of providing a core character from every story branch of the Discworld continuum. I mean, I love the City Watch. If I could only have one set of characters I would go with them. Vimes, Carrot, Angua, Nobby, Fred, and a brick built Detrius...perhaps reminiscent of the Rock species Crash and I have in this project. But that would be unfair to fans of the Witches, the Wizards, and the Death novels...so this is my compromise and I think it is a solid one. If you really really really want a sixth figure, then what we are going to have to do is get this project to 10,000 supporters as quickly as possible. It is no guarantee but the faster a project get to 10,000, the higher the proven demand is and likely the better chances that other character could be added. Above is Rincewind and his Luggage and a Silhouette of the planned future Granny Weatherwax figure that I am currently working on. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Please consider also reviewing these other worthy projects From left to right, then row by row: The Little Prince Assault on Wayne Manor Perry the In-Action Figure Ur-Quan Masters (Star Control) Majestic Airship Train from Back to the Future Legend of Korra Mecha Tank The Guild (Knights of Good) Lady Sabre and the Ineffable Either Hubble Space Telescope And here is a list of Other great projects if you are so inclined to be curious.

First, to The LEGO Group and the Cuusoo team for the opportunity for LEGO fans to have their creations realized as actual sets. Also, to Sherlockology for their dedicated support for this project - it wouldn\u0027t have happened without you guys! And to Glenbricker\u0027s Review for all the help and great renders. Finally, to all the amazing fans of Sherlock for the incredible support. Your passionate display of support has, I\u0027m sure, made an impression with LEGO. Thanks again to all who voted for this project! This creation is based on the wonderful BBC drama \"Sherlock\", a contemporary update of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u0027s world famous detective Sherlock Holmes. The set recreates the consultation room from 221 B Baker St., the flat of Mr. Sherlock Holmes. As shown, the set contains 370 pieces. I think the set should come with a sticker sheet for the mirror and rug. The set was designed with the adult collector and/or fan of the show in mind and so accuracy in matching the set was a priority. There are a number of building techniques employed throughout the set and I believe it would be an enjoyable build. This set will feature three mini figures: the brilliant Sherlock Holmes, his faithful companion John Watson and the wonderful Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock\u0027s landlady. Please consider supporting my other project: The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker UPDATE 9/6/13: Eye colors have been corrected and Sherlock\u0027s shirt is now purple. UPDATE 9/10/13: New render of the set! Many thanks to Glenbricker\u0027s Review for the render! UPDATE 9/12/13: Alternate/expanded version of set! See Added Section 2 UPDATE 9/16/13 New Cover. Render provided by Glenbricker\u0027s Review Added Moriarty UPDATE 9/20/13: Added Lestrade, Molly, and Mycroft. Mr. Holmes is ready to receive clients in his consultation room. The room is crammed with books and features two comfortable chairs, a cozy fireplace and Holmes\u0027 desk with reading lamp. There is also a side table with teapot, and a hat rack topped with the iconic Deer Stalker. Also included would be Sherlock\u0027s laptop which is not shown as it is difficult to render. Render provided by: Glenbricker\u0027s Review This is an alternate/expanded version of the set, featuring Sherlock\u0027s couch and iconic wallpaper. The wall paper would be 5 stickers measuring 3x6 (bricks). I have also created a display stand for the set. The set at this size would be about 630 pieces, 450 without the display stand. One other feature with this set would be a card, printed with a view of baker street, visible through the windows. Render provided by: Glenbricker\u0027s Review This is my concept for what the characters from the show would look like as minifigs. From L to R we have the deliciously evil Jim Moriarty, Scotland Yard\u0027s best Inspector, Lestrade, Sherlock\u0027s landlady, Mrs. Hudson, lab tech and Sherlock fangirl, Molly Hooper, and Sherlock\u0027s brother, aka the British Government, Mycroft. These are presented as a possibility if this project is made into a set. Would/should all of them be included in a set? If LEGO were to produce my original concept, basically half of Sherlock\u0027s consulting room, I would imaging it would come with Sherlock and John, and maybe one or two other figs. The larger (read: much more expensive) set could easily contain ALL of the figs.","tag":["Sherlock","Sherlock Holmes","Detective","Drama","Watson","awesome","bbc","MOC","flailx","cumberbatch"],"status":"Project Not Approved","initialTime":0,"endTime":0,"div":7.073419171037546,"concern":0.08624639436944732,"no_supporter":10000,"no_follower":371,"no_expert_comment":0}]
